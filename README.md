A convenient way to display multiple cards on screen.  
Not meant for deck building, there are better resources for that.

- A friend and I want to play Dice Masters remotely via webcam.
I don't own all the cards; It would be convenient to have all of the opponent's on a monitor, at a glance.
Especially true for beginners that don't have them memorized.


- I want to share an arbitrary set of cards with someone else, through a single link
