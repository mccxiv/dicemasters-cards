## A web page to view and compare Marvel Dice Mastersâ„¢ cards.

#### Use cases
- A friend and I want to play Dice Masters remotely via webcam.
I don't own all the cards; It would be convenient to have all of the opponent's on a monitor, at a glance.
Especially true for beginners that don't have them memorized.


- I want to share an arbitrary set of cards with someone else, through a single link

#### Features and status
- [x] Search for cards
- [x] Save individual cards so that a new search won't clear them
- [ ] Ability to share a set of saved cards via url

#### Tasks
- [x] Develop a [node package to scrape cards](https://github.com/mccxiv/dm-lookup)
- [x] Implement the first step of search, before the images roll in
- [x] Finish implementing search, now with images
- [x] Create separate sections, one for search and one for saved cards
- [ ] Create minimalist UI that isn't hideous
